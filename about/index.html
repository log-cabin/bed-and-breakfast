    <p>
        Andre and Linda are longtime residents of North Bend. 
        They purchase this beautiful land in 1983 with dreams to build a log house on it. 
        With their many travels to Montana to see other log houses and plans...
        They just looked at each other one day and said, well we don't 
        need to have anyone else to build this, being the master 
        craftsman that Andre is they agreed. We can build this our selves. 
        So the log trucks came and 7 months of hand peeling logs began! 
        It took a family effort, with some of the children still living at home 
        to help even the family yellow lab "Sandy".
        <br/><br/>
        They moved into their new Log home in May 1989. Andre was still 
        commercial fishing in Bristol Bay, Alaska and is now retired after 
        30 years. Linda along with Daughter Tammy began having Christmas bazaars 
        in a little cabin on the property, and Log Cabin Creations was born. 
        Lots of Log furniture started to be crafted and this meant expanding 
        a couple more times, to accommodate all our furniture and gift accessories.
        <br/><br/>
        After hearing from our customers over the years oohing and awing over 
        the Beauty of the Mountains and river We now wish to 
        share it all with you as a Bed and Breakfast.
